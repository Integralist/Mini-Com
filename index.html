        <h1>Mini-Com</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Mini-Com (short for 'minifier' and 'combiner') is a PHP script which takes in a list of comma separated filenames (without the extension) and then combines them into one file and minifies the results using <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/">YUI Compressor</a>.</p>

<p>I had originally written a group of <code>Regular Expressions</code> for compressing the CSS code but I've now decided that as we're using YUI Compressor for the JavaScript it makes sense to just use it for the CSS as well.</p>

<h2>TODO</h2>

<p>The following items are on the TODO list:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Integrate some form of cache mechanism so that the YUI Compressor isn't being called on every single page view.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean up the API (some how?) as I personally feel Query String data is <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fugly&amp;defid=3859324">fugliy</a> as hell.</p></li>
</ul><h2>Server Set-up</h2>

<p>It's worth noting that when running this code on an Apache server everything runs great. But when I took this script into a work environment where we have a dedicated Windows 2003 Server the code just refused to work (and to make things worse the YUI Compressor wasn't feeding back any errors of any kind - just an empty Array).</p>

<p>It turns out that (for us any way, your usage may vary depending on your Windows set-up...) our server engineers had to allow read + execute permissions for a Plesk user <code>psacln</code> to the directory where Java was installed. AND they also enabled ASP.NET permissions for the inetpub directories.</p>

<p>It took ages for them to figure it out, so if you do try and use this on a Windows server then hopefully some of this information may help you.</p>
